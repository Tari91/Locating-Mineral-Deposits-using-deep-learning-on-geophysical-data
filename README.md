🚀 **Mineral Deposits Detection Suite**
Deep Learning Framework for Geophysical Data Analysis

🧠 Project Overview
The Mineral Deposits Detection Suite is a deep learning framework designed to locate mineral deposits from simulated geophysical survey data.
It uses synthetic geophysical grids resembling real-world anomaly patterns and applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict potential mineralization.
